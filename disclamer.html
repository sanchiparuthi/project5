<h1> DISCLAMER
</h1>
            <p id="disc"> 
                The information contained in this website has been gathered and curated by interviewing multiple <br> 
                children who are fed up of their caregivers' parenting skills. They all now claim to <br>
                resent their guardians for exhibiting certain behaviours and hope this project serves <br>
                not only as a guide on how to do better, but their experiences- as a cautionary tale to <br>
                prevent you from harming/ losing your kids mentally, emotionally or even physically.<br>
                <br> The situations mentioned in the following piece are very common and humane experiences, <br>
What is uncommon- is dealing with them/ supporting someone else dealing with them in sensitive, healthy ways.
<br> That is precisely what this project aims to make the user think about. <br>  
                The user is also requested to excuse the irritable tone of the piece. <br> 
                Neither is this our job, nor should it be our responsibility but nevermind all of that. 
                <br>
                Thank you.
            Happy parenting! 
            </p>
